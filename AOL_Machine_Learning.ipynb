        "        'New questions are being asked about President Donald Trump s ability to lead after he slurred his words during a speech about his Jerusalem decision. Possible reasons for this include: fatigue, a dry mouth (the White House explanation), the use of drugs or alcohol, a problem with his dentures or more troubling issues dealing with his mental or physical health. Morning Joe reported this morning that, unlike other presidents, Trump has opted not to get his physicals at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.Questions about Trump s mental stability have been growing over the last few months. While he has never been viewed as a stable person in the traditional sense, his tweets and comments have gotten more erratic. He was widely criticized recently when he retweeted several anti-Muslim videos that were posted by radicals in the United Kingdom.One psychiatrist talk to MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnel about his impressions of Trump s state of mind.Many think that any degradation in Trump s mental state may be due to the increased pressure he is feeling from Robert Mueller s investigations into collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. This has increased since former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.All of this talk is leading to more people to ask if Trump should be removed from office, citing the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Jamie D. Raskin (D-MD) has circulated a  dear colleague  letter suggesting just that. As published in the Washington Post, it says: Please join a rapidly growing group of colleagues in cosponsoring H.R. 1987, the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. It sets up and defines the Congressionally-appointed  body  called for by the 25th Amendment. Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, the Vice-President and a majority of the Cabinet or the Vice-President and a majority of  such other body as Congress may by law provide  can determine that the President is for reasons of physical or mental incapacity unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. The 25th Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1967, but in the last 50 years Congress never created the  body  that its language contemplated. Perhaps it never occurred to prior Congresses that setting up this body was necessary. For obvious reasons, it is indeed necessary, and now is the time for us to do it. While the Republicans in the Cabinet and Congress may not yet be ready to take this step, it is out there.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images',\n",

        "        '(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court in Washington on Tuesday upheld a lower courtâ€™s decision to allow President Donald Trumpâ€™s commission investigating voter fraud to request data on voter rolls from U.S. states. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) watchdog group, which filed the lawsuit, did not have legal standing to seek to force the presidential commission to review privacy concerns before collecting individualsâ€™ voter data. EPIC had argued that under federal law, the commission was required to conduct a privacy-impact assessment before gathering personal data. But the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously that the privacy law at issue was intended to protect individuals, not groups like EPIC. â€œEPIC is not a voter,â€ Judge Karen Henderson wrote in the ruling.  Washington-based U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly first denied EPICâ€™s injunction request in July, in part because the collection of data by the commission was not technically an action by a government agency so was not bound by laws that govern what such entities can do.  Kollar-Kotelly noted that the commission, headed by Vice President Mike Pence, was an advisory body that lacks legal authority to compel states to hand over the data. Most state officials who oversee elections and election law experts say that voter fraud is rare in the United States. Trump, a Republican, set up the commission in May after charging, without evidence, that millions of people voted unlawfully in the 2016 presidential election in which he defeated Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton despite losing the popular vote.  The commissionâ€™s vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states in June to turn over voter information. The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories.  More than 20 states refused outright and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commissionâ€™s eventual findings could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder for groups that tend to favor Democratic candidates to cast ballots. EPIC executive director Marc Rotenberg could not immediately be reached for comment. ',\n",
        "        'JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African politician Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Thursday it was fine if the country s white business community declined to endorse her bid to succeed President Jacob Zuma as leader of the African National Congress (ANC). Her priority was to transfer wealth from the white minority to the black majority, who are generally much poorer. Those who opposed the policy were mainly white people or members of the black elite who want to preserve the status quo, she said.  If we have to choose between our people having a better life and investment, that s not a choice,  she said, when asked about whether her policies could scare away businesses.  I m not afraid. I m not afraid of them. But I m not surprised white minority capital is not endorsing me,  she said on ANN7 television in a rare interview. ANC delegates will vote for a new party president next month, with Dlamini-Zuma expected to face Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a unionist-turned-millionaire businessman who is more popular with foreign investors.  From where I sit, it s looking good. The campaign is going well,  said Dlamini-Zuma, who was married to the president.  The winner of the party vote will be favorite to become the next president of South Africa, either at an election in 2019, or before if Zuma stands down or is forced out by the new ANC leadership next year. Apartheid in South Africa ended in 1994 but much of the country s wealth resides with the white minority. Successive ANC governments have said they want to empower the majority, though many black people have seen only modest economic gains. Dlamini-Zuma, who has held several cabinet posts and was most recently chair of the African Union, has pledged to tackle poverty and close the gaping racial inequality gap. Some investors are concerned about Dlamini-Zuma s proposed plan of  radical economic transformation , which critics have said is a populist term that isn t backed up by solid policies. ',\n",
        "        'DUBAI (Reuters) - King Salman has appointed or promoted 56 judges, Saudi Arabia s state news agency SPA reported on Thursday, a step coinciding with an anti-corruption crackdown in the kingdom.  The king issued a royal order that promoted 26 judges and appointed 30 others at different levels of the judiciary, SPA said.  Saudi authorities have arrested dozens of royal family members, officials and businessmen in the anti-graft purge that began on Saturday. They face allegations of money laundering, bribery, extortion and exploiting public office for personal gain. It was unclear if the judges will have any role in the widening crackdown. Regulators in the United Arab Emirates have asked banks for information about citizens detained in the investigation, a possible prelude to freezing their accounts. Saudi Arabia has announced it will confiscate assets improperly acquired, and while Riyadh has set no timetable for any such confiscations, banking sources say more than 1,700 domestic bank accounts have already been frozen at the request of the central bank. Huge amounts of money may be at stake. Corruption has over the years siphoned off $800 billion from Saudi state revenues and bankers believe much of it is held abroad, in countries including Switzerland and Britain. ']\n",
